# Stage Traits

## MartianStage Trait

Abstractly, a stage in martian has certain features
* Inputs to the stage and outputs from the stage
* Inputs to each chunk and outputs from each chunk
* `split()`, `main()`  and `join()` functions

In the rust world, it makes sense to define an entity with well defined feature like this as a [Trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.8.0/book/traits.html). The `MartianStage` trait is defined as follows:

```rust
trait MartianStage {
    type StageInputs;
    type StageOutputs;
    type ChunkInputs;
    type ChunkOutputs;
    fn split(...) -> ...;
    fn main(...) -> ...;
    fn join(...) -> ...;
}
```

> [!TIP]
> Defining a martian stage in rust is equivalent to creating a `struct` which implements the `MartianStage` trait. The stage `struct` need to specify the 4 types and implement the 3 functions in the trait.


You might be wondering how martian knows when to execute the functions in the trait and how it interacts with rust to achieve the same. If you want to know more, read the page on [language-specific adapters](https://martian-lang.org/writing-stages/) in the martian lang docs. Essentially it boils down to a rust executable which martian can call with specific command line arguments. We will call this executable an `adapter` (because it's a martian rust adapter). There is logic within the adapter to execute the right code based on the command line inputs. In short, we need the following pieces to build a martian stage in rust:

* `adapter`: a rust executable which can be called by martian
* `MartianStage`: structs implementing this trait. 

> [!NOTE]
> A single adapter can implement multiple stages. So it makes sense to lump all the rust stage code falling under a pipeline under a single adapter.


## MartianMain Trait

A martian stage can also have just the main function with no split and join. Such a stage has the following features:
* `main()` function
* Inputs to the stage and Outputs from the stage

The corresponding trait definition would be:
```rust
trait MartianMain {
    type StageInputs;
    type StageOutputs;
    fn main(...) -> ...;
}
```
> [!TIP]
> Defining a martian stage with just main in rust is equivalent to creating a `struct` which implements the `MartianMain` trait.

`MartianMain` trait is a subset of the `MartianStage` stage. In fact any type `T` which implements `MartianMain` also implements `MartianStage` by construction.
