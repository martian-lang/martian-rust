The martian-rust adapter failed while deserializing the file "invalid_args.json" as martian::metadata::tests::test_decode_err::Foo due to the following error:

invalid type: null, expected i32 at line 3 column 15

This typically happens when one or more fields in the struct martian::metadata::tests::test_decode_err::Foo cannot be built from the JSON. The contents of the JSON are shown below: 
   1: {
   2:     "bar": 100,
   3:     "val": null
   4: }
