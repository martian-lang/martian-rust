error: The input to the martian_filetype! macro needs to be two items separated by a comma.
    The first item is the struct name that will be generated and the second item is the filetype extension within double quotes.
    For example martian_filetype! {TxtFile, "txt"}
 --> $DIR/test_three_inputs.rs:3:20

3 | martian_filetype! {TxtFile, txt, foo}
